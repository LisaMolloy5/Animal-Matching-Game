*** 

### Colour scheme
The colour scheme of the website is various shades of greens. These were chosen as they are colours that are associated with animals and zoos.

### Typography
'Fuzzy Bubbles' was the chosen as the title font for this game as it is eye catching and fun to match the game.
'ABeeZee' was the chosen font for this game as it is a children's learning font and is friendly and easy to read. 'Sans Serif' was used as the fallback font for the website in case the other fonts do not load properly.

### Images
The images used on the website are of cartoon animals and a cartoon zookeeper to match the games zoo and animal rescue theme and appeal to children who are the target user for ther game.
